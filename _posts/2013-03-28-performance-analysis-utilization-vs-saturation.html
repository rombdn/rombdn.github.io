When investigating performance problems, checking saturation is usually a good start : by definition, any saturation is a bottleneck because it means queueing.

While in batch processing saturation is not a always a problem (e.g when queueing jobs), this is usually not the case for a end user / online transaction where any saturation will probably impact response time. In practice this is usually a very bad situation because it means that the number of requests from clients is greater than the system processing capacity, which can rapidly leads to timeouts for clients...

Saturation may appear at different levels :
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height:13px;">Physical : CPU (Runqueue), I/O (response time, queue), Memory (swapping). You can find a pretty exhaustive list here : <a title="USE Method : Linux Performance Checklist" href="http://dtrace.org/blogs/brendan/2012/03/07/the-use-method-linux-performance-checklist/" target="_blank">The USE Method: Linux Performance Checklist</a>
</span></li>
	<li>Software : Application servers message queue length</li>
</ul>
Now let's compare utilization and saturation in a very general case of online transactions. I made these graphs - of a very general situation I admit - to illustrate theses points. The system is supposed to be single core. (Note : I represented runqueue = 2 as the normal situation : one thread can run on CPU and the other can wait for memory or I/O, the rule of thumb is Runqueue should be &lt;= available cores).

Transaction response time :

CPU Utilization :

RunQueue :

Okay it's not very realistic but it can help to illustrate some empirical observations :
<ul>
	<li>Transaction response time is not (strongly) correlated with physical resources utilization, contrary to saturation (runqueue).</li>
	<li>The system can generally handle some saturation ( 3 &lt; runqueue &lt; 5) but after a certain threshold response time will rapidly degrade.</li>
</ul>
Good analysis!
